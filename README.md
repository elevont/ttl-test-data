# RDF/Turtle test files

[![REUSE status](
    https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/elevont/ttl-test-data)](
    https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/elevont/ttl-test-data)

This repo contains an assemblage of [RDF/Turtle] test files from different sources.
It's primary use-case is for unit-testing serializers and pretty-printers for the [RDF/Turtle] syntax.

**NOTE**
This repo is entirely generated.
If you want to change anything in here,
do so in [the generating repo](https://github.com/elevont/ttl-test-data-generator/),
or [raise an issue there](https://github.com/elevont/ttl-test-data-generator/issues/).

While this is a git repo, recording a meaningful history is not a goal of this repo.
It is rather to be used simply by referring to the latest version on the 'master' branch.
Yet it is a repo, as this makes it easier to be used in many scenarios,
including Rust(lang)s cargo build system.

- ... smells like a contradiction? -> Yes!
- ... are we simply lazy? -> ... yes! :/

## Licensing

This repo uses both the [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) way of indicating licenses
(note the LICENSES folder in this repo),
and the less precise but more common way of having a single LICENSE file,
as this is more commonly supported and understood, both by humans and machines.
